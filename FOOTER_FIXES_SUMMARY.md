# Footer Visibility Fixes & Production Improvements

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Footer Text Visibility Issues**
- **Problem**: Footer text was using `text-muted` class which made links and content nearly invisible on the dark footer background
- **Solution**: Updated all footer text to use `text-light` and proper contrast colors

### 2. **Navbar Branding Duplication**
- **Problem**: Navbar was showing "Peter Emmanuel's Portfolio" creating redundancy with the name
- **Solution**: Updated navbar to show only the full name (`{{ personal_info.full_name }}`) for cleaner branding
