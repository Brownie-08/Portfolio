# Contact form settings
CONTACT_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
SEND_AUTO_REPLY=True
ADMIN_EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX=[Portfolio Contact] 
```

**Replace:**
- `your-email@gmail.com` with your actual Gmail address
- `your-16-character-app-password` with the app password from Step 1.2

try:
    send_mail(
        'Portfolio Email Test',
        'This is a test email from your Django portfolio.',
        settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL,
        [settings.CONTACT_EMAIL],
        fail_silently=False,
    )
    print('‚úÖ Email sent successfully!')
except Exception as e:
    print(f'‚ùå Email failed: {e}')
"
```

## üìß **Step 5: Test Contact Form**

1. Go to your portfolio contact page: http://127.0.0.1:8000/contact/
2. Fill out and submit the contact form
3. Check your Gmail (both on mobile and computer)

   - **Admin notification** with the contact details
   - **Auto-reply** sent to the form submitter

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"Authentication failed" error:**
   - Double-check your app password (16 characters, no spaces)
   - Ensure 2FA is enabled on your Google account

2. **"SMTPAuthenticationError":**
   - Verify your Gmail address is correct
   - Make sure you're using the app password, not your regular password

3. **Emails going to spam:**
   - Set up the Gmail filter from Step 3
   - Add your own email to contacts

4. **No mobile notifications:**
   - Check Gmail app notification settings
   - Ensure the app has notification permissions in phone settings

## üìã **Email Templates**

### **Admin Notification (to you):**
```

From: your-email@gmail.com
